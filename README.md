Disclaimer 
----------
We know that you may not have extensive … or any … experience with the technologies below, so the point of this exercise is not to prove your expertise.  You got to this point in the process because we believe that you have the ability to assimilate the basics of modern technologies.  Now is your time to prove it.

What We Want
----------
A web application that displays some simple data and allows for a simple update or two.  There are very few specific requirements -

1.	Use the UML below as the definition for the data you’ll be displaying / updating.  You do not need to implement all of this but what you do has to match this diagram.

2.	The front end has to be AngularJS.  Again, don’t start to sweat if you’ve never even touched it – we’re looking for basic implementation - not high level experience.
3.	Data must be traferred over restful services created with Microsoft’s WebAPI framework.
4.	Data must be accessed via EntityFramework 
5.	Code must be deposited on GitHub


You do not need to go overboard – you don’t have to add security or logging or 3-D visualizations.  There requirements are purposefully vague as we aren’t generally concerned with the what, rather the how.

Where to Start
----------
We don’t want you to worry about the insignificant details, so we’ve setup this seed project on GitHub for you to use as your foundation.


Bonus Points
----------
- Bootstrap
- EntityFramework Code First
- Sky’s the Limit…
- It runs
